            <p className='about-content'>With a background in music performance and composition, I find coding similar to composing music. Just as a composer crafts melodies, I build software, ensuring each line of code contributes to a functional whole. My music experience hones my creative problem-solving skills. Whether orchestrating an application or composing music, I approach both with passion and dedication. My goal is to merge my love for music with my tech expertise, creating elegant and effective solutions for users and clients.</p>
            <p className='about-content'>I am also passionate about video games, which inspire my approach to coding. The intricate worlds and engaging mechanics of games fuel my creativity and drive to build user-friendly applications. Whether playing or coding, I bring the same enthusiasm and attention to detail, always striving to create innovative solutions that captivate and delight users.</p>
            <p className='about-content'>In addition to coding and music, I also enjoy Muay Thai, biking, cooking, tending to my houseplants, and spending time with my friends and family.</p>
